			//These objects will not do the serializing themselves, instead, they use the serializer and use serialize. THIS WAY,
			// the specific objects will serialize as properly.
			// Issue is, how do I get that back?

			//Map, length
			// key,
			// list, length
			// ...
			// 
			//The question is effectively, how do we get back lists, and how do we get back nested types, like lists in lists or something like that.
			//The point is, I've been addressing the serialization of something like a dictionary as a single list in a straight line

			//Not to mention, this object is incapable if of even handling entries for loading because the for each would be empty.
			// I could change how the iteratable is handled, something like that. Rather, the idea when an iteratable object is detected
			//  I just have a function forcibly turn it into a vector (I'd turn it into an array but then no for looping) Maybe use std::array? prob not.
			//  Then once it's done like that, I iterate over it?
			//  NO! I can stick it back into the iterating object. But it will need a different function, that's much more tailored.
			// <!> This function will need to resize, and/or will need to place objects in their either key slots, or in their indexed slots.
			// Indexed slots aren't hard but making it compatible with mapped slots will be a pain.
			// In terms of how to store lists, it will have to be relavent value
